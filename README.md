A bot for users to privately say whatever in a server

This is just a simple bot I made a while ago for a private server with me and my friends
to be able to talk without us knowing who was talking in case we needed to
say something privately or for a game or whatever.
It's extremely simple, just has code to recognize it is being messaged, and
to respond in a specific channel with whatever was said.
While this code should be mostly intuitive, I will write comments.
Feel free to copy everything but the token it's not like I own or came up with
this idea or plan on selling this bot.
